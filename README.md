# Music Genre Classification
 The aim of this homework is to develop a music source separation system specifically for chorales. We have to decomposing a mixed audio wav file into its constituent canonical voices found in chorale compositions.
 Music source separation refers to the process of isolating individual instruments or vocal parts from a combined audio signal. In the case of chorales, which typically feature distinct voice parts, the goal is to extract the soprano, alto, tenor, and bass voices from the overall mixture.
